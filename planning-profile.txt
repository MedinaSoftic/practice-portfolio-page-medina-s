Tasks
Step 1: Plan Your Profile Page
Think about how you want your profile page to look and what content to include.
The page should contain:
1. A Header: Includes your name and a brief tagline (e.g., "Aspiring Web
Developer").
2. A Section with a Profile Picture and About Me Text: Use a placeholder
image or a real one.
3. A Skills List: Include at least 3 skills presented in a list (ordered or
unordered).
4. A Footer: Add any additional information, such as a copyright message or a
link to your GitHub profile.
Step 2: Create the HTML Structure
In your HTML file:
1. Write semantic HTML using tags like <header>, <section>, <ul>/<ol>, and
<footer>.
2. Ensure your content is well-organized with meaningful IDs or classes for
styling.
Step 3: Write the External CSS File
Create a separate CSS file to style your HTML:
1. Link the CSS File: Use the <link> tag in the <head> section of your HTML file
to connect the CSS.
2. Add CSS Rules: Style the elements in your HTML file using element selectors,
class selectors, and ID selectors. Focus on:
○ Setting background colors.
○ Adjusting text alignment, colors, and fonts.
○ Adding spacing and padding to elements.
Step 4: Test and Iterate
1. Open the HTML file in your browser to see the styling applied.
2. Adjust the CSS rules as needed to achieve the desired look.
